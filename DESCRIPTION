Title: Read Tables from Stack Overflow Questions into R
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Edward", "Visel", email = "edward.visel@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Sometimes you see a really interesting question on Stack Overflow, 
    but the asker only presents the data as a presentation-style table instead 
    of as runnable R code. Fear no more! read.so will turn even heinous tables 
    into data frames and code in a trice.
