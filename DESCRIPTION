Title: Read Tables from Stack Overflow Questions into R
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R:
    c(
        person(
            given = "Edward",
            family = "Visel",
            role = c("aut", "cre"),
            email = "edward.visel@gmail.com",
            comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0002-2811-6254")
        )
    )
Description: Sometimes you see a really interesting question on Stack Overflow, 
    but the asker only presents the data as a presentation-style table instead 
    of as runnable R code. Fear no more! read.so will turn even heinous tables 
    into data frames and code in a trice.
